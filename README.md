# MemoryGame
This is a Udacity FEND project made using vanilla JS. As my first project real projedct uploaded un github please review and comment.

### How to Run the game:
Visit [this page](https://lucassantiagolopez.github.io/MemoryGame/), or clone the repository/download the zip to run the game locally in your browser of choice.

### How to play:
To play, click on a card and try to select its match by clicking on another card. The game will track your time in seconds and moves and assign you a star rating based on your total number of moves. You've won the game once every pair has been matched. You've lost the game if you reach 100 moves before winning.

### Features:
- Animations for each open, not matched and matched card.
- A restart button that will let you start the game from scratch with different cards arrangment.
- A winner and loser banner with animation that includes a button to play again and your final score.
