This is a Udacity FEND project made using vanilla JS. As my first project real projedct uploaded un github please review and comment.

### How to Run the game:
Visit [this page](https://blablabla.sh/), or clone the repository/download the zip to run the game locally in your browser of choice.

To play, click on a card and try to select its match by clicking on another card. The game will track your time in seconds and moves and assign you a star rating based on your total number of guesses. You've won the game once every pair has been matched.

### Features:
- Animations for each Open, not matched and matched card.
- A restart button that will let you start the game from scratch with different cards arrangment.
